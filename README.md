### This project analyzes a large covid dataset (owid-covid-data) in SQL server. It then creates views for visualiaztion in PowerBI and exports data related to key factors to Python for further analysis. 
- To be more specific, the project calulates the total cases, deaths, and vaccination in the world and by continent and year (2020-24) as well as the top 10 countries/regions in terms of the percentages of vaccination and infection.
- The views are created after the calculations, which then are imported to PowerBI for visualization.
- The subset containing the data in relation to the countries/regions with the highest percentages of total deaths and vaccination as well as selected socioeconomic, demographic and health-related factors are exported to Python for furhter analyzing the relationships between them.
