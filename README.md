### This project analyzes a large covid dataset (2020-24) from Our World in Data in SQL server (2019). It then creates views for visualiaztion in PowerBI and exports key factors data to Python for further analysis. 
- To be more specific, the project calulates the highest percentages of population infected and vaccinated by country/region or continent. The views are created after the calculations, which then are imported to PowerBI for visualization.
- The subset containing data in relation to the countries/regions with the highest percentages of total deaths, the percentages of vaccination as well as the selected socioeconomic, demographic and health-related factors are exported to Python for furhter analyzing the associations between the factors.
