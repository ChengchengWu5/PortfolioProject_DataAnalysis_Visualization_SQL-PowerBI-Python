/* This project analyzes a large covid dataset (2020-24) from Our World in Data in SQL 
   server (too large to be analyzed in Power Query). It then creates views for 
   visualiaztion in PowerBI and exports key factor data to Python for further analysis.
   
   To be more specific, the project calulates the highest percentages of population 
   infected and vaccinated by country/region or continent. The views are created after 
   the calculations, which then are imported to PowerBI for visualization. The subset
   containing data in relation to the countries/regions with the highest percentages 
   of total deaths, the percentages of vaccination as well as the selected socioeconomic,
   demographic and health-related factors are exported to Python for furhter analyzing
   the associations between the factors. */
